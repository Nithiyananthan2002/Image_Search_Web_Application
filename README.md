# Image_Search_Web_Application
The image search web application uses HTML to create a user-friendly search interface for browsing images. CSS styles the layout to ensure a clean, responsive display of search results from the unsplash API. JavaScript handles user input, fetches images from Unsplash, and dynamically displays them on the page based on search queries.
